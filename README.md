PCA is unsupvervised 
PCA has no concern with the class labels. 
PCA tries to find the directions of the maximum variance in the dataset. In a large feature set, there are many features that are merely duplicate of the other features or have a high correlation with the other features.
Such features are basically redundant and can be ignored. 
The role of PCA is to find such highly correlated or duplicate features and to come up with a new feature set where there is minimum correlation between the features or in other words feature set with maximum variance between the features.
Since the variance between the features doesn't depend upon the output, therefore PCA doesn't take the output labels into account.
